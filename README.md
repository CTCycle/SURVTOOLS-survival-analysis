# SURVTOOLS-survival-analysis

## Project description
SURVTOOLS is a state-of-the-art digital toolkit designed to streamline survival analysis. It offers a wide range of methodologies, making it a versatile tool for users across different domains. The primary goal is to empower doctors and researchers by providing a user-friendly platform equipped with built-in survival analysis techniques. This not only simplifies the process but also enhances the accuracy and efficiency of survival analysis. With SURVTOOLS, you can focus on what truly matters - deriving valuable insights from your data, while we take care of the complexities of survival analysis. Join us in our journey to make survival analysis more accessible and intuitive for everyone.

## How it works
Any .csv file stored in the project/dataset folder will be automatically loaded, and user is prompted to select target columns (based on their indexes) to perform the survival analysis. Grouoping (treatment) column, columns reporting events and columns reporting associated times are requested to the user, and can be selected by typing their index numbers (separated by commas).
